                <p>Your Sun Sign is the zodiac sign that correlates with your birthday.
                    This is what most people are acquainted with when it comes to Astrology.
                I was born on October 1st so my sun sign is Libra. The sun sign shows
                the innermost parts of your personality and who you are at your core.Your rising
                    sign also known as the ascendant is the sign that was rising on the eastern
                    horizon when you were born. It represents the side of you that is most apparent
                    to people when you're just starting to open up. The rising sign is a big part
                    of your personality and some people even consider it more important than your
                    sun sign.
